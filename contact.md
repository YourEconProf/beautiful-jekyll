### Kernmantle Research:

This is where I'll put info about my current research. Right now, I am focusing moving all of my accumulated data and calculations over to R, and automating the creation of my graphs. Soon, I'll begin linking those here.

### Old Projects:

This is where I will house links to the FMEX project and GARCHKIT, two (very) old resources that still get some attention from time to time.
