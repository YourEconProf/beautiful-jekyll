A few months ago, a poster on Twitter made an assertion that's become pretty common since the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum in the Spring of 2018:

![This tweet started it]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/2018-10-30-Twitter1.png)

The idea that domestic steel and aluminum producers are gouging US manufacturers because they have raised prices since the tariffs were imposed is a misunderstanding of both the ostensible justification of tariffs (to increase jobs/save domestic industry) and economic theory. After the tweet above, the poster and I went on to have a conversation about this very fact, and I think I helped him understand why higher prices from domestic producers aren't a side effect or nefarious, but in fact are the express and desirable outcome of the policy.

I was reminded of this exchange this morning when I saw a story that White Industries, a US-based manufacturer of high-end bicycle parts has begun to impose a 4% materials surcharge on their products. The reaction was as expected:

But again, this is a feature, not a bug, nor is it gouging, or even simple supply-and-demand. (Though, of course, it is supply and demand.) It works like this:

Let me explain why, honestly, you shouldn&#39;t hold this against the US companies...they are doing *exactly* what they *should* be doing. 1/n</p>&mdash; Matt Roberts (@YourEconProf) <a href="https://twitter.com/YourEconProf/status/1022127933727617024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
