title: Things Farmers Don't Talk About: Passwords
tags: [personal, computing]

I make about 40 stops on the rubber chicken circuit each fall. Talking to farmers and others in the grains industry about markets, the economy, risk management, and farm management. But where those conversations go is never predictable. Many times they stay close to the topic at hand, straying only from marketing to futures or trade policy. Other times, they stray far and wide; in December, a 30 minute Q&A following a talk on grain markets turned into a wide-ranging discussion of Farmers and the Affordable Care Act.

Along the way, there are many other conversations big and small, on-topic and random. And every now and again, I think I have something concrete to offer on a topic that's not  related to economics. Today is the result of some of those conversations, and the topic is password security.

Password security is sort of like flossing, we know its important, and we know that ignoring it will make *bad things* happen. At the same time, there is almost always something more pressing, and so they often get pushed aside. But when that day comes that you are sitting in the periodontist's chair, you will wish that you had paid more attention. 

Well, I've put together a short video to talk about password security, why its important, what most people (and companies!) get wrong, and what you can do, right now, to fix it.
