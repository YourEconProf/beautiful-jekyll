A few months ago, a poster on Twitter made an assertion that's become pretty common since the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum in the Spring of 2018:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This part upsets me. “The automaker buys most of its steel from U.S. producers, who have RAISED PRICES in reaction to tariffs on imported steel”. To make more money! <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@realDonaldTrump</a></p>&mdash; Furmo (@furmo4752) <a href="https://twitter.com/furmo4752/status/1022103201141673984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 


The idea that domestic steel and aluminum producers are gouging US manufacturers because they have raised prices since the tariffs were imposed is a misunderstanding of both the ostensible justification of tariffs (to increase jobs/save domestic industry) and economic theory. After the tweet above, the poster and I went on to have a conversation about this very fact, and I think I helped him understand why higher prices from domestic producers aren't a side effect or nefarious, but in fact are the express and desirable outcome of the policy.

I was reminded of this exchange this morning when I saw a story on [the Radavist](https://theradavist.com/2018/10/white-industries-adds-a-tariff-surchage/) that White Industries, a US-based manufacturer of high-end bicycle parts has begun to impose a 4% materials surcharge on their products. The reaction was as expected:

But again, this is a feature, not a bug, nor is it gouging, or even simple supply-and-demand. (Though, of course, it is supply and demand.) It works like this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">First, apologies for being snarky earlier, and thanks for calling me on it. Let me explain why, honestly, you shouldn&#39;t hold this against the US companies...they are doing *exactly* what they *should* be doing. 1/n</p>&mdash; Matt Roberts (@YourEconProf) <a href="https://twitter.com/YourEconProf/status/1022127933727617024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

* So, imagine that company A is losing money because they can't compete with foreign company B. The government steps in and places a tariff on imports from company B's country.
* This raises the cost of buying from B, so people shift to ordering from A, and their quantity sold, and produced, goes up. But this doesn't automatically mean that A is profitable.
* If the problem with A is that its cost of production is higher than B, pre-tariff, then higher volume at the same price means bigger losses, not smaller losses. Therefore, to increase profits enough that A can expand, and hire more workers, A has to raise prices.
* That is why economists consider a tariff a tax...it is always a tax on consumers and producers. Depending on the particularities of the market, it may fall more on consumers or more on producers, in every case, they both share the burden. 5/n
* This is also why economists are in universal agreement that tariffs don't help the job market. Because while A might now be making more money and expanding, all the consumers and/or firms who buy A's product have to buy less of other things to afford the higher prices.
* The most commonly cited example are the steel tariffs imposed under Bush43 in 2002, in which its well-accepted that for every job that was saved/created in steel-production, 4-5 were lost in steel-using industries, such as cars, appliances, etc. 


The right way to handle unemployment as a result of increased trade is to provide the newly unemployed with stipends/training/benefits for a long-enough period of time to transition to other careers. But in the US, we deride that as welfare. However, economic theory is pretty clear that there are enough gains from trade to pay for this and still leave everyone better off.
