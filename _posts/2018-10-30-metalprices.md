A few months ago, a poster on Twitter made an assertion that's become pretty common since the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum in the Spring of 2018:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This part upsets me. “The automaker buys most of its steel from U.S. producers, who have RAISED PRICES in reaction to tariffs on imported steel”. To make more money! <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@realDonaldTrump</a></p>&mdash; Furmo (@furmo4752) <a href="https://twitter.com/furmo4752/status/1022103201141673984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 


The idea that domestic steel and aluminum producers are gouging US manufacturers because they have raised prices since the tariffs were imposed is a misunderstanding of both the ostensible justification of tariffs (to increase jobs/save domestic industry) and economic theory. After the tweet above, the poster and I went on to have a conversation about this very fact, and I think I helped him understand why higher prices from domestic producers aren't a side effect or nefarious, but in fact are the express and desirable outcome of the policy.

I was reminded of this exchange this morning when I saw a story that White Industries, a US-based manufacturer of high-end bicycle parts has begun to impose a 4% materials surcharge on their products. The reaction was as expected:

But again, this is a feature, not a bug, nor is it gouging, or even simple supply-and-demand. (Though, of course, it is supply and demand.) It works like this:
